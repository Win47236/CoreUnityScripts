I had my initial game dev meeting today. We discussed creating cutscene like beginnings and ends in order to add scope to the game, but really dig in and develop the plants, the potion crafting, recipe books, etc. The simulation part of the game. Then develop the first customer. Then the next. The cop will likely be third but could have a lot of unique functionalities to it. The end of the mini game would have a shadowy figure in the door way delivering a request for your assassination. But the cutscene doesnâ€™t get into that at all, just adds the opportunity for a part 2.
